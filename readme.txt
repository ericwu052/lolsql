So I try to follow a medium post which describes how to create our own
NoSQL. Because it's a medium post, I'm not sure if you can open it
nowadays. So I included the original source code in Crystal Language
in the crystal folder.

As you can see, it's a simple NoSQL where it just store string in string
key. I intent to reimplement it in Rust to learn more about rust. However
I found an annoying thing about my implementation. Please see this issue
for more detail. And let's discuss it over the issue.

Thank you in advance if you're going to give constructive comment!
